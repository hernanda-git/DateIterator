# IterateThroughDate Method

Hello! I discovered that the `IterateThroughDate` method can be quite useful in certain situations, and I would like to share it with you. This method is a simple yet powerful tool that allows you to iterate through a range of dates, providing outputs for the start of each year, month, and the exact date of each day in the range.

## Function Description

`IterateThroughDate` is a static function that takes two parameters: a `startDate` and an `endDate`. The function will iterate through each date from the start to the end and will perform the following:

- At the start of the iteration, it prints the year of the start date.
- For each date in the range:
  - If the date is the first day of the year, it prints the year.
  - If the date is the first day of the month or it is the start date, it prints the name of the month.
  - It always prints the date in "MM/dd/yyyy" format.

## Function Code

```csharp
public static void IterateThroughDate(DateTime startDate, DateTime endDate)
{
    Console.WriteLine(startDate.Year);
    for (DateTime currentDate = startDate; currentDate <= endDate; currentDate = currentDate.AddDays(1))
    {
        if (currentDate.Day == 1 && currentDate.Month == 1)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(currentDate.Year);
        }
        if (currentDate.Day == 1 || currentDate == startDate)
        {
            Console.WriteLine(currentDate.ToString("MMMM"));
        }
        Console.WriteLine(currentDate.ToString("MM/dd/yyyy"));
    }
}
```

## Usage

The IterateThroughDate method can be used in various scenarios. For instance, if you want to keep track of certain events or deadlines throughout a certain period, or perhaps you are developing a calendar app and you want to iterate through dates.

Here's a simple example of how you can use the function:

```csharp
DateTime startDate = new DateTime(2023, 1, 1);
DateTime endDate = new DateTime(2023, 12, 31);
IterateThroughDate(startDate, endDate);
```

The above example will iterate through each date in the year 2023, printing the year at the beginning, the name of each month at its start, and each date in the "MM/dd/yyyy" format.

I hope you find this function as useful as I do. Happy coding!
